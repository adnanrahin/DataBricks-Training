### What is Databricks SQL?
Databricks SQL is a Databricks environment designed with SQL analysts in mind. You can use the built-in SQL query editor to write highly-performant queries directly on your organization's data lake, so you can be sure you are always working with the most complete and current information available.

### SQL Endpoints
A Databricks SQL Endpoint is the computational resource that powers your queries.Your SQL Endpoint will be set up and configured for your use by your Databricks Workspace Admin.

### Databricks Database
In general, you will be querying cleaned and prepared data that has been organized into tables for you. A Databricks Database is a collection of tables.  When you enter the Query Editor and select your running SQL endpoint, you will also see a list of databases you can access. When you choose one, you will see a list of the associated tables in the schema browser that appears directly below.
